Established in 2005 as Mimi Hair and Body Care, the salon operated out of Blooms & Greens Flower Shop, providing both beauty services and flowers to the Jackson area. The popularity of the salon eventually led to the conversion of the space into a full-service salon and in 2011 current owner Shara Buday, a member of the original staff, bought the salon from her sister and rebranded it as Champu Salon. Under Shara\'s visionary ownership Champu has continued to grow into one of Jackson\'s most fashionable salons, offering clientele the latest in hair and beauty trends within the unique mountain locale. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Staff</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shara Buday, Owner</h3>\r\n<p>As the salon owner and founder of the Champu brand, it is Shara\'s vision and style that define the identity of Champu Salon. With a natural gift for color and a passion for styling, Shara has been helping clients achieve their ideal look since she joined the industry in 2001. After developing her career in Boston for four years Shara moved to Jackson in 2005 to become an original staff member of the salon, then known as Mimi Hair and Body Care. In 2011 Shara bought the salon from her sister and established Champu Salon, with a goal of becoming the area\'s premier provider of haircare and beauty. Today, Shara\'s vision continues to grow the salon and has allowed her to achieve her dream of owning a salon brand that is completely her own, while continuing to provide clients with the excellent service they\'ve come to expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Audrey Getter</h3>\r\n<p>Audrey first began developing her skills as a professional in the beauty industry as a makeup artist at Clinique. While attending school at Artistic Beauty College to become a certified cosmetologist, Audrey also had the opportunity to learn as an apprentice under one of Arizona\'s top stylists. Audrey\'s ten years of experience as a stylist at high-end salons in Prescott, AZ, in addition to her certification as Pureology stylist and dedication to continuing education keep her ahead of the latest industry trends. A yoga instructor on the side, Audrey loves to spend her free time reading fashion and style blogs and playing in the beautiful outdoors of Jackson Hole.   </p>\r\n<h3>Jen Jeffers</h3>\r\n<p>Nunc ut tortor fermentum, sollicitudin leo vel, ultrices tortor.
